## 🎮 How to Play

The objective is simple yet challenging: **Pick up passengers and drop them off at their destinations before time runs out.**

1.  **Pick up Customers:** Look for pick-up points at the bottom of the HUD. Stop your taxi on them to pick up a passenger.
2.  **Manage the Clock:** Every passenger has a strict time limit for picking up and dropping off. If the timer hits zero, you lose the game.
3.  **Route Optimization:** You can carry up to **4 concurrent passengers** (once seats are unlocked). Plan your route carefully to pick up and drop off multiple people efficiently.
4.  **Emergency Events:** If a passenger requests an urgent trip to the **Hospital**, all other seats will be locked until you complete that delivery. This is your top priority!
5.  **Scaling Difficulty:** The game gets faster and harder as you complete more jobs.
